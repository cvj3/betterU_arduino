Pin definition :
* PIO8 connects with LED cathodea with 470ohm series resistor in between. LED NEGATIVE connects to ground. It is used to indicate the module state. After powered on, flashing intervals differ in different states.
* PIO9 is used to control LED indicating paring. It will be steady on when paring is successful.
* PIO11, module state switching pin. HIGH -> response to AT command; LOW or floating -> regular work status.
* With build-in reset circuit, reset is completed automatically after powered on.
* Steps to set to MASTER:
* Set PIO11 HIGH with a 10K resistor in between.
* Power on, module comes into AT Command Response Status
* Open HyperTerminal or other serial tool, set the baud rate 38400, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity bit, no Flow Control
* Via serial port, send characters "AT + ROLE = 1 r n",if successful, return "OK r n", where r n is carriage return.
* Set PIO11 LOW, re-power, then in Master state, automatically search for slave module and connect.
